# ADR 0001: Record Architecture Decisions

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to record the architectural decisions made in this project. This will help us document the reasons behind key technical choices and provide a historical record for future contributors.

## Decision

We will use the [MADR (Markdown Any Decision Records)](https://adr.github.io/madr/) format to document architecture decisions. Each decision will be recorded in a separate file within the `docs/decisions/` directory.

## Consequences

- Contributors will have a clear understanding of why certain decisions were made.
- The project will have a structured and consistent way to document decisions.
- Maintaining ADRs will require discipline and regular updates.
